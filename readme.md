The U.S. Constitution in Git
=============================

This is an experiment; a repository for the U.S. Constitution
where amendments are presented as patches.
E.g., instead of the First Amendment being placed at the end (as is usual),
it will go inline in Article 1, Section 9 (Limitations of Congress).

Proposed amendments will be presented as branches, ratifications as merges.

See [this thread on the git mailing list][thread]
for details about the back-dating of commits.

(at your option) any later version.

The Constitution itself is not under copyright.
